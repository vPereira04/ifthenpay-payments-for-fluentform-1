Adds ifthenpay payment methods to FluentForms: cards, wallets, and local payment options; supports secure one-time payments via pay-by-link.

== Description ==

This plugin integrates the ifthenpay payment gateway with FluentForms to enable seamless payment collection directly from your forms.

Payments are processed through a secure pay-by-link system, ensuring that no sensitive card or banking data is stored on your website.

After form submission, users are redirected to a secure ifthenpay payment page where they complete the transaction. ifthenpay then sends a server-side callback to automatically update the payment status inside FluentForms.

In plain terms you get:

* One-time payments directly from FluentForms
* Secure automatic payment confirmations
* Payment status synchronization inside FluentForms
* Support for cards, wallets, transfers, and local payment methods
* Merchant backoffice management on web and mobile
* No card numbers stored on your website

All settings are configured directly in FluentForms and the ifthenpay Backoffice.

The plugin is designed so site owners can manage payments without requiring deep technical knowledge.
